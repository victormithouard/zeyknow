Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPlisten

What does a sound look like? The goal this weekend is to capture creative videos or photos showing a visual interpretation of a sound. Some tips to get you started:

You can find sound almost everywhere. It can come from things close to us, like teapots or people laughing, but also from objects in our recent past, like phone dials, typewriters or tape recorders. When people see your photo, you want them to immediately hear a sound in their minds. Let a unique noise around you draw your attention, then frame your shot to show the action and best convey the sound. For video, avoid music in favor of the ambient sounds in everyday life. From the roar of a train leaving the station to the strike of a match, seek to capture footage where sound and motion come together to bring a moment to life.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPlisten hashtag only to photos and videos taken this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged image or video taken this weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
