The work of Andrea Dezsö (@andreadezso) cannot be pinned to just one medium. Born in Transylvania, the Romanian artist moves between colorful marker paintings to etched glass panels to cut paper to sculpture while exploring mysterious creatures, ornamental  patterns and whimsical darkness. “The imagery generally comes from my imagination,” she says. “I often combine visual elements from nature and characters that I invent to create scenes.” Dividing her time between New York and Massachusetts, Andrea’s work can be seen by passersby at two New York City subway stations. “My inspiration was to create visually uplifting, colorful scenes for people to enjoy during their commute,” she says. Andrea’s diversity in mediums comes from her eagerness to play with materials: “I love markers, brush pens and color pencils — and building up details obsessively to make an image really rich.” She often tests her experiments online by sharing photos and videos of her projects with the community. “It’s risky and fun to share images of works-in-progress with people,” she says. “I’m interested in how people respond to the images and like to share in the creative experience.” Photo by @andreadezso
