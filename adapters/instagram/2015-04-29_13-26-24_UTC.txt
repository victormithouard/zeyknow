“It was literally like a ‘Willy Wonka’ dream.” Roots drummer and “Tonight Show” bandleader Questlove (@questlove) is once again geeking out about food –– specifically the recent trip he took to a Seattle lab to learn about the intricacies of science-based cooking. “I am now more into science than actual music,” he admits. 
Questlove, born Ahmir Khalib Thompson, is most definitely a food lover (see also: @questlovesfood, where he documents the otherworldly meals he eats). He’s also a professor, a traveler and, of course, a musician. His musical origin story begins in Philadelphia in 1974, when a then three-year-old Ahmir got a toy drum set. Four years later, his parents surprised him on Christmas with a slightly more official seven-piece kit. “I won’t ever be surprised like that again,” he says. “I guess the second best thing for me to do is to create that moment for a lot of people.” For more of Questlove’s food and music discoveries, follow @questlove.
