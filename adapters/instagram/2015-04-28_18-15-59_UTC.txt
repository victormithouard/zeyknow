“#Hellomynameis Hugo Rodriguez (@hgrdrgz). I’m a 19-year-old aspiring photographer living in Iowa, but originally from the small town of Villachuato in the Mexican state of Michoacán. I always try to show something I may never see again, something someone else may never see. I mostly find this in nature and portraits. I’m inspired by my friends, and all young artists who dare to make a difference by being different. We, as young creators, are not the future of this world. We are the present." Photo by @hgrdrgz
