In this edition of #whoifollow, food writer and home cook Nigella Lawson shares some of her favorite accounts on Instagram. “I am an evangelical sharer of the things that make me happy — be they food, flowers, or other images that give me joy. In many ways, it’s of a piece with the pleasure I get in feeding people. All my follows are fueled by my greed, but I follow people not just because they feature food, but because their posts make me actually feel that I’m eating what they eat, or that I need to eat what they’re eating! As a Londoner, I find @clerkenwellboyec1 essential, as he takes me to restaurants I might not otherwise go to, and he always seems to know about places even before they open properly. I have developed something of an obsession for @birdsblack. Since following them, I’ve bought their book, cooked their pies and have become passionate about passing on the pie love. One of my followers tipped me off about @dennistheprescott, a Canadian food blogger who posts food that makes my tummy rumble. I cannot see one of his pictures without wanting to eat whatever’s in it. @urbancottageblog posts not just food, but pictures that are so beautiful they fill me with happiness. I love that there are other people who get pleasure from a picture of wooden spoons!” —@nigellalawson
