Chilean architect Mirene Elton (@mireneelton) is constantly building something, and her photography is no exception. “I enjoy erasing elements like the sky or some other part of the context to highlight another element,” says Mirene, who uses an editing app to play with contrasts in color that sometimes obscure parts of an image entirely. “My photographs are more graphic pictures than realistic images.” Mirene uses her camera to draw as she might on her blueprints. “A common characteristic in my pictures is that they tend to capture planes, similar to the way architecture is technically drawn in frontal views,” she says. “I usually capture an image with little or no use of perspective.” Capturing images of Chile's diverse landscapes has also inspired her studio work. “I think my formation as an architect and my love for photography have made a good blend. Both complement each other and make me see architecture and nature in a different way.” Photo by @mireneelton
