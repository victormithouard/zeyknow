Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPcolorplay

To celebrate the arrival of new seasons and our Color and Fade tools, the goal this weekend is to capture creative photos and videos that explore the playful world of color all around us. Here are some tips to get you started:

Challenge yourself to find colors that delight you or catch your attention unexpectedly. If you have a favorite color, keep it in mind as you explore and see where it appears. How can you see it like you never have before? Next, seek out or create moments where color is the main subject and has a life of its own. Finally, remember to have fun! Pair colors in unexpected ways, play with patterns and let your imagination run wild.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPcolorplay hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. Any tagged image or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
