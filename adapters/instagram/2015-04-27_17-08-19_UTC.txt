Over the past few years, emoji have become part of a universal visual language. And just as we share photos and videos, we use emoji to communicate emotions and feelings in ways that anyone can understand, regardless of language or background. Starting today, emojis will now work within hashtags, so you can discover even more by adding them to your own photos and videos, searching them on the Explore page and tapping on them when you see them in captions.

As part of our commitment to creativity, today we're also excited to introduce three new filters — and we plan to bring you additional ones more regularly going forward. Inspired by the spirit of a weekend adventure outdoors, Lark, Reyes and Juno are a family of modern, subtle filters that brighten and enhance your photos in refined, beautiful ways.

To learn more about emoji hashtags and the new filters, check out blog.instagram.com.

Instagram for iOS version 6.11.0 is available today in Apple’s App Store, and these updates will be available today on the latest version of Instagram for Android version, 6.20.0, in Google Play.
