You can thank Harry Potter for Emily Ables’ (@blueeyedbiblio) infectious love of literature. When the 18-year-old Ohioan first encountered the boy wizard, it was — appropriately — a magical moment. “It showed me how much stories can do,” Emily says of the J.K. Rowling series. “Once I learned how many lives I can live through stories, all I wanted was to read, read, read.” Emily started her book-centric Instagram last year, and her followers consider her an expert in young adult novel recommendations. “I love when people read a book because they know I loved it,” she says. “Sharing the love of reading is a great feeling.” Photo by @blueeyedbiblio
