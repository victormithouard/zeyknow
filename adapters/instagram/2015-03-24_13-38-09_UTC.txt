“I started doing origami on a family holiday in France two years ago,” recalls Wenche Lise Fossland (@wenlise_fold) of Namsos, Norway, whose interest in paper folding was sparked by a beautiful origami lamp. “It is fascinating that there is almost no limit to the shapes you can turn a flat paper into.” When the holiday was over, Wenche Lise couldn’t stop folding. “One fold took the other and I started searching for all kinds of designs,” she remembers. Finding inspiration in origami online tutorials, Wenche Lise adds her own touch to each piece by creating lively environments for the paper figures, usually with a humorous, unexpected twist. “I even look at the vegetables in the grocery store in a different way now,” she says. “A fennel can be an exotic island and the broccoli has great potential to be tree material in my origami world.” Photo by @wenlise_fold
