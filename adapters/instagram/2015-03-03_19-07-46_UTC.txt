Sylt, Germany’s northernmost island, may be connected to the mainland by rail, but many travelers flock to the “Queen of the North Sea” in order to disconnect. Sylt’s major draw is its picturesque places: think thatch-roofed houses, sandy beaches and tidelands. For Hamburg-based Instagrammer Anja Sauer (@anja.sauer), Sylt is the perfect escape from the city. “Rough sea air, beach as far as the eye can see and wonderful variegated dune landscapes — there I find the width and the endless horizon I need to completely switch off.” Even though Sylt is a mere 38 square miles (99 square km), its offerings are diverse. One can tour the island by bicycle, surf off of Westerland’s Brandenburg Beach, visit a gallery opening in Kampen or simply relax in one of the iconic white and blue painted two-seater beach chairs that are scattered along the island’s beaches.
