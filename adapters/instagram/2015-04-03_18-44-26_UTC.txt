Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPcandid

The goal this weekend is to capture creative photos of people in candid moments. Some tips to get you started:

Take your camera everywhere and never stop shooting. Whether among friends or a crowd of strangers, the best candid shots are ones where you feel as if the camera was never there. As you shoot, try to blend in and keep your camera out of the way. Make sure the flash is off, and try shooting from the hip. Find a space with a background that interests you, frame your composition then wait for an unusual moment to pass through to complete the shot. Finally, respect your local laws and the people you're photographing. Only shoot in public spaces and be kind if someone notices you and asks not to be photographed.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPcandid hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
