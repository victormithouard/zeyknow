“Then, from afar, you can hear its whistle and the mechanical movements. It’s really like tschoo-tschoo-tschoo-tshcoo-tschoo nonstop, and then a big tchoooooh-tchoooooooooh!” says Kim Leuenberger (@kim.ou), describing the Jacobite steam train — a Hogwarts Express lookalike — pass over the Glenfinnan Viaduct, the Scottish crossing that is so famous for its appearances in the Harry Potter films that it’s earned the nickname “The Harry Potter Bridge.”
Kim, a Swiss photography student living in London, was recently on a trip through the Scottish Highlands with her father, who is as much of a Harry Potter fan as she is. They were determined to capture the Glenfinnan while the train was crossing. “We checked the timetable and were first to reach the spot where you can see the train, up a small hill and over a fence. We waited for 30 minutes as more and more people from all over the world started to join us. We were like kids, so excited. You hear it arrive a bit beforehand and then when it passes the bridge it releases some vapor, just like in the film.” Photo by @kim.ou
