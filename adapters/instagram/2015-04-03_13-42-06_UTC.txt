Canadian stay-at-home mom turned artist Sarah Henrich (@madewithluvca) has developed a keen interest in connecting kid-friendly art with Judaism. It all started when Sarah realized that she forgot to pack a menorah for Hanukkah while living abroad in Austria with her husband and two young daughters. “I went to the local craft store looking for something that would work in some way and saw Fimo clay,” she says. “I played with Fimo when I was a child and knew I could work with that. There was a beautiful selection of colors, so I bought lots of clay and got to work on a menorah.” After first creating a princess-themed menorah for her oldest daughter, Sarah got to work on a mezuzah case, a decorative holder for parchment that is inscribed with verses from the Torah. “I sent a picture to my mother of the mezuzah case and she of course posted it to Facebook,” says Sarah. “And the rest is history.” Sarah makes each of her custom mezuzah cases by hand and enjoys seeing people’s reactions to these unique works of art. But for Passover, Sarah looks forward to her mother’s creations: “I love my mother’s matzo bagels. When I think of Passover, I think of the bagels.” Photo by @madewithluvca
