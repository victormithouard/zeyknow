“I put so many hours into creating these works,” says Meghan Maconochie (@meghanmaconochie), a South African schoolteacher who creates textured images drawn from pop culture references, which she constructs from the shavings of colored pencils. “I like to create pieces that people can relate to and recognize.” Meghan’s process begins by hand-drawing an image onto paper or a card, which gives her a base to work on. Next, she applies a thin layer of shavings on the outer edges. “I then layer it up so it has more of a sculptural look to it,” she explains. Meghan sharpens each pencil by hand to achieve the particular coarseness she prefers, sometimes going through an entire box of pencils to create an image.  Despite the time she invests in her artwork, the physical renderings are ephemeral. “I am experimenting with different fixatives to see if I can preserve the image,” she says. “Sadly, at the moment, I throw them away after photographing them.” Photo by @meghanmaconochie
