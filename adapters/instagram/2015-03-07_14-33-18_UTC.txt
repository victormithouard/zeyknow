“I was 13, upset, angry and confused. My parents had just separated and I decided I was leaving on the next train out of town.” With that, Ravi Mishra (@ravimishraindia), a schoolboy from northern India, ran away from home, and arrived in the city of Mumbai. In the years that passed before he spoke to his family again, he worked his way through school doing a series of odd jobs, including stints as a tour guide, bringing foreigners to the slums of Mumbai, and recruiting tourists to work as extras in Bollywood films. Eventually he began working with photojournalists, who recognized his talent and encouraged him to pursue his own photography — including his ongoing project on Holi, India’s springtime festival of colors. Ravi continues to make images of India, as he travels with the photographers, journalists, and news teams that assists. He remains modest about his photography, saying, “I still have so much more to learn. I am aspiring because I am not a professional.” He adds, “but I also use the word aspiring because it gives freedom to my mind to learn from everyone. Photography is what keeps me going.” Photo by @ravimishraindia
