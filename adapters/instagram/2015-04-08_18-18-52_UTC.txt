“Bats are the bees of the mammal world,” says Caroline Greco (@nightingalequilts), who has nursed back to health more than 30 bats from her home in New South Wales, Australia.

Caroline hopes to demystify and soften perceptions of these creatures among a bat-wary public. “Without them whole ecosystems will collapse, with a domino effect passing on to human society,” she says.

The bats in Caroline’s care are not pets. She’s specially trained to know the rehabilitative needs of each rescued bat so that it can be returned to the wild. Handling of adults is kept to a minimum, for instance. And for young bats, a priority is placed on preparing them to interact with others. “We provide them with toys and enrichment to keep their minds active and ensure they develop into well-adjusted juvenile bats ready to learn social skills from adult bats,” says Caroline, adding, “The priority is the animal’s welfare.” If you encounter an injured bat, says Caroline, the best way to keep yourself and the bat safe is to call local wildlife experts with proper training and vaccinations.
