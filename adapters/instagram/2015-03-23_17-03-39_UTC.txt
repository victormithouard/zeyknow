Today we’re announcing Layout from Instagram, a new app that lets you easily combine multiple photos into a single image. It’s fun, it’s simple and it gives you a new way to flex your creativity.

As you choose photos from your camera roll, we automatically show you previews of custom layouts. You’ll find a Faces option that shows you all of your photos that feature people. For spontaneous moments, Photo Booth starts a countdown to let you capture photos that instantly appear in a layout.

From there, you have total artistic control. Drag and drop photos to rearrange them, pinch to zoom or pull the sides of each photo to adjust its size. Then flip and rotate your photos to create cool arrangements and mirror effects. With Layout, it's easier than ever to unlock your creativity—and we can't wait to see what you’ll make next.

Layout from Instagram is available today on iOS in Apple’s App Store. Layout from Instagram will be available for Android in the coming months.
