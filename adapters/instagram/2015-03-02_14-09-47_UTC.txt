“Marseille is a patchwork of old neighborhoods, all in the typical Marseille style,” says Romaric Lopez (@romdilon), a caterer who moved to the French coastal city from Avignon last year. Founded over 2,600 years ago, Marseille is France’s oldest city and its second-largest. Romaric, who lives in Marseille’s cultural district, called Old Port, takes advantage of exploring local landmarks like the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations (@mucem_officiel), designed by French architect Rudy Ricciotti, and the Notre-Dame de la Garde, a 19th century Roman-Byzantine basilica which overlooks the city.
