“If you see someone on a bicycle in Paris about to get run over by a tour bus, it’s probably me,” says Taylor Holland (@euro_bus). For Taylor, an American artist based in Paris, a fleeting encounter in front of the Eiffel Tower four years ago has blossomed into an enduring relationship. His project, called “Eurobus,” began after he spotted a bus with a rainbow graphic on it during his morning bicycle commute. “As I rode closer, it drove away and I couldn’t catch up,” he says. “I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so I started looking around the city and discovered other buses with equally amazing graphics.” Taylor became so fascinated that he started photographing the tour buses on his commute every day. “The hard part starts when they drive away and I have to chase them down,” he says.
