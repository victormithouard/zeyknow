“I like to think of myself as a power clasher,” says Karen Doolittle (@karendoolittle), who by day is a social worker for adults with developmental disabilities. A few years ago, the 27-year-old photographer began documenting friends in the psychedelic rock scene of the California Bay Area, and her love of rainbows emerged from their style and spirit of rebellion. “I moved to San Francisco and I was just blown away,” says Karen. “It’s one of the most vibrant, colorful places that I’ve ever been to in my life, and it kind of saved me in a way. It showed me that there was a whole big world out there, that there was a different way to be beautiful, a different way to be creative, a different way to be valuable.” She adds, “The use of the rainbow in my photos is both an ode to San Francisco and a symbolic statement about being your most vibrant, genuine self.” Photo by @karendoolittle
