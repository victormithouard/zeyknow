As she checks on each model moments before a fashion show begins, Sandy Hullett (@sandyhullett) pauses to take a picture. “I view my photos as a continuation of my work, a kind of record of the backstage atmosphere,” says Sandy, who is the hairstylist Guido Palau's first assistant. Their work begins with a meeting with the makeup artist, manicurist, stylist and designer to view a collection and discuss ideas for the whole look. For the Prada (@prada) show during Milan Fashion Week, the hairstyle was designed around the jewelry. “The colors of the clothes were beautiful and the fabrics and accessories, amazing,” Sandy says. “I loved the idea that a girl would use a beautiful brooch on her dress and then use the same ones in her hair.” Photo by @sandyhullett
