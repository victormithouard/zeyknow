The latest show of the artist José Parlá (@joseparla), at the High Museum of Art (@highmuseumofart) in Atlanta, includes new paintings with rich textures, layers and his signature calligraphy. “I am interested in walls I see around the world that allow the viewer to find a clue to their history, but also much more — the history of a place,” José says. The show, open until May 24, includes two-sided, sculptural pieces in a room at the museum made almost entirely of glass. “The work can be photographed from all angles of the space, as well as from outside,” says José, who lives in Brooklyn. “My favorite time is around 4:30 p.m., when you can photograph your own shadow — or that of a friend — on the surface of one of the sculptures.” photo by @joseparla
