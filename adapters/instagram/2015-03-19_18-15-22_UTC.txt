“#Hellomynameis Emmanuel Olunkwa (@stop__ok). I’m 21 years old and attending college in New York City. I had a cerebral abscess on my brain and two surgeries back-to-back, which is why I have an incision across my head. I’ve been described as a photographer, but I would say I’m more of a visual artist and writer. I like creating in any way that I can.” Photo by @stop__ok
