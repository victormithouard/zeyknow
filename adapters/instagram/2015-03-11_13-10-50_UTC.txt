“My mind is always filled with a diverse, bizarre and sometimes tedious imagination,” says embroidery-maker Su-jung Kim (@lazy_needlework), who taps into that imagination when she immerses herself in her projects. Su-jung has long had an interest in antiques and needlework, and then seven years ago, she happened to meet a tutor to help her hone her craft. Now, she runs a small workshop in South Korea, where she specializes in wool embroidery and works on a variety of projects ranging from handbags to linens to small accessories. “It takes two days to one week to make a handbag,” explains Su-jung, who has mastered the craft to the point where she can design her own bags and include different needlework techniques, such as quilt ribbon embroidery and patching. Su-jung draws creativity from what surrounds her: “I find inspiration in nature, everyday things, people and even the works of others.” Photo by @lazy_needlework
