“There’s a comfort in things that loop. I think that as a species we’re drawn to things that are innately hypnotic,” says London-based digital designer Natalia Stuyk (@nataliastuyk). Natalia creates animated videos and gifs in response to the shapes, textures and colors she sees around her. Her short loops are often silent as they are a work in progress, but she uses sound as the starting point. “I write the soundtracks first, which dictate the rhythm of the movement and cuts of the video,” she says. Natalia looks at a still image and wonders how it might move, and says she is fascinated with repetition. She admits she is never fully satisfied until she knits together her videos seamlessly. “I like it most when you can’t tell where something starts and ends, it just goes on forever,” she says. “I feel like everything I create has a similar visual rhythm.” Video by @nataliastuyk
