“The country was just opening up, and it seemed like the right time to go,” says Andre Malerba (@amcaptures), an American photojournalist based in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Two years earlier, after traveling to Nepal and Thailand, Andre had decided to immerse himself in a pivotal moment in Myanmar's history, as a military government began to relax restrictions on political freedom and foreign visitors. “I have a front row seat to a country opening up to the outside world, attempting to transition to democracy, and all the awful and great things that go along with it,” he says. Andre describes a universal, humanistic approach to his work, saying, “Part of being a good photographer is being open and honest with the people you photograph. People can tell when you’re not hiding parts of yourself from them, and I honestly believe it’s appreciated.” Photo by @amcaptures
