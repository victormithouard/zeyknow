Between photo assignments, Julia Xanthos (@juliaxanthos) looks for love. As she bustles through New York City as a staff photographer for the “New York Daily News,” Julia stops to photograph couples kissing on park benches, hugging in the subways, holding hands on the train, and embracing on top of skyscrapers—all posted with the hashtag #younglove. “There are never enough pictures of people in love,” she says. 
The effect of photographing so many intimate moments has not been lost on her personally. “Taking pictures of people kissing has helped me heal my heart and also open it up at the same time.” Recently, Julia got engaged and the feeling of falling in love is beyond words, or pictures, for her. “There’s no hashtag for it, I’ll say that. It’s just been the most beautiful experience of opening my heart up to somebody who is so incredible and is the love of my life. I don’t know any other way to put it.” Photo by @juliaxanthos
