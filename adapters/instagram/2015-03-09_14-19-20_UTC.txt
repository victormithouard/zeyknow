In this edition of #whoifollow, the fashion designer Stella McCartney shares some of her favorite Instagram accounts: “Instagram works when it’s real and honest and heartfelt and instinctive. I am always drawn to my horse pictures or close-ups of my children because for me it captures a moment and a memory. And I love doing little videos of the shows and moments in my career that you wouldn’t ever get to see if they were not on my account. I love that I can encounter so many different people in so many different walks of life and they can have an impact on me and my work. I follow my sister, the photographer @maryamccartney, because it’s a nice way for me to connect with her. I follow the artist @petcortright, because I love her work and we have collaborated together. I also follow @meatfreemonday, because I think it’s a really important, informative message. I support @officialpeta, because there is nobody else like them and they are extraordinary in everything they do. @natgeo, because they are amazing.” —@stellamccartney
