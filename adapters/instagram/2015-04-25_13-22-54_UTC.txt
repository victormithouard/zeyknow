“I worship the way of Zen, which teaches me what minimal really is,” says Dhavebaj Anupabsthian (@dhavebaj), who lives in Thailand’s Trang province. Following the theme of transforming the complex into the ordinary, Dhavebaj presents minimalist images by fusing his photography with graphic arts. All Dhavebaj needs to make his pieces are a mobile phone camera, a few graphic editing apps on his tablet, the Instagram creative tools and some good music to get his productive energy going. He also keeps symmetry in mind: “I try to choose the proper lines to be in the background that suits the emotion,” he says.
