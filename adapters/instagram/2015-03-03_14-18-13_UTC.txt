Simon Porte Jacquemus (@jacquemus) — a young, playful fashion designer showing his collection in Paris today — has discovered that when it comes to posting photos, three isn’t a crowd. Simon tells stories through a trio of similar images, each with a different zoom or cheeky twist. “I just quickly realized that posting three was more strong and beautiful,” he says. “It’s kind of a signature.” Simon, 25, has also become known for exaggerated silhouettes and vivid colors in the six years since he launched his line. His photos elaborate on that story. “They’re about my everyday life in the Jacquemus studio, with colors, graphics and a smile.” Photo by @jacquemus
