“#Hellomynameis Caleb Zahm (@calebzahm). I’m a 19-year-old photographer from Indiana. Photography is everything to me. It’s what really makes me want to wake up. My first job was umpiring baseball games when I was 14, and I saved up for a used camera. Ever since, I can’t go a day without shooting. I try to travel as much as possible. I love to talk to anyone that will talk to me — to learn about their culture or their life. I have never been lost for inspiration.” Photo of @calebzahm by @samkfare
