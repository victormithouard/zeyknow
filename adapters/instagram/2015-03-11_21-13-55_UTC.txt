Until a year ago, sled dog racing in Alaska was not on the bucket list of stories to photograph for Katie Orlinsky (@katieorlinsky). Then the freelance photographer got an unexpected assignment that exposed her to the extreme world of mushing, as sled dog racing is called, and she hasn’t looked back. This week, Katie is following the teams racing on the famous Iditarod Trail and documenting their 1,000 mile trek across Alaska’s tundra. More than winning, survival is the primary goal. “Out on the trail in between checkpoints, which can be over 100 miles, the mushers and dog team have to be completely self-sufficient—they carry supplies for camping, cooking, frozen food for the dogs and human,” explains Katie. “They need to know how to pace themselves, when to camp, when to rest, and for the competitive teams how to also be fast and win.” To see more of Katie’s photos of the action on the Iditarod Trail, follow @katieorlinsky.
