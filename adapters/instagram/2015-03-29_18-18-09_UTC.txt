Shinjiro Ono (@marutaro) had no intention of owning a dog until he met Maru, a half-grown Shiba Inu who had been for sale for over a month at a pet store in his neighborhood near Tokyo. “My wife and I decided that if it was still there the following week, we would take him home,” reflects Shinjiro for this edition of #todayimet. Little did Shinjiro know that Maru would become one of the most adored pets on Instagram — and open Shinjiro up to a community full of new friends. 
Tokyo designer Daisuke Kujiraoka, who goes by the name Halno (@halno), shares a series of “levitation” photos that he started with a group of friends he met through Instagram. “We were exploring aesthetics that would be fun for us to shoot, and the broomstick levitation captures eventually became my trademark,” he says. Since then, the works of his team have sparked the curiosity of many people, and the group has recently begun to share their creative process more broadly though InstaMeets.

Last February, Shinjiro, Maru, Halno and Halno’s team met up for the first time, where they spent an entire afternoon doing a photo shoot. “We told Shinjiro about the images we had in mind, and Maru just followed Shinjiro’s instructions,” says Halno. “It was impressive to see how much friendship, love and trust exist between the two.” Photo by @halno
