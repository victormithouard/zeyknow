In December's creative tools update, we introduced five new filters and brought you the ability to tweak perspective as part of the Adjust tool. Today, we bring you two new creative tools: Color and Fade.

Use the Color tool to tint the highlights or shadows in your photo. You can choose from yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, cyan or green to add a colorful flair to the moments you share. The Fade tool allows you to bring a quiet tone to your photos by softening colors.

Instagram for Android version 6.19.0 is available today on Google Play, and Instagram for iOS version 6.10.0 will be available in a few days in Appleâ€™s App Store.
