Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPfromthewater 
The goal this weekend is to capture moments that reflect upon our connection with water. Our project takes its inspiration from Balazs Gardi (@balazsgardi), a Hungarian photojournalist who has spent the past decade photographing water in all its forms around the world. His images include moments of celebration and times of crisis, depicting a precious resource in situations that range from abundance to scarcity. “Water can be beautiful or lethal, worshipped or abused,” explains Balazs, reflecting on the floods, droughts and moments of daily life that he records. “Instead of photographing water itself, I try to visualize how we all relate to it, how we interact with it every day and what it means to us,” he explains of his approach.

Balazs offers this advice to get you started: “Whether it’s a person or a river, I tend to photograph my subjects from up close. If you don’t have a waterproof case, just use a few strips of gaffer's tape to seal the speakers and other places where water could get in, and hold onto your phone tightly. Always be prepared to grab moments that never come back, but when you are in control, you think first and then shoot. Understanding the message you want your photo to convey is just as important as aesthetics.” PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfromthewater hashtag only to photos and videos taken this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged image or video taken this weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
