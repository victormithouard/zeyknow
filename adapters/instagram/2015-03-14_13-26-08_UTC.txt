“For me, baking is like meditation,” says Shivesh Bhatia (@shivesh17), an 18-year-old political science major from New Delhi. “Creaming the sugar with butter, whisking the flour with baking powder, playing with chocolate and fruits, layering and frosting the cake, decorating it and finally digging into it — the entire process is so much fun.” Three years ago, Shivesh encountered the works of a Swedish baker and fell in love with the idea of baking. Now he whips up everything from cupcakes with meringue frostings to berry pies to apple galettes, but always keeps the focus on having fun. “I believe in creating incredible desserts from simple techniques and basic ingredients,” says Shivesh. “If you invest your love in what you are baking, nothing can go wrong.” Photo by @shivesh17
