Born with cerebral palsy and suffering from a degenerative eye condition, Ukrainian Stanislav Krawczyk (@standarkart) remembers his childhood as a constant battle. Confined and isolated by hospital walls, Stanislav developed the urge to express himself, and by the age of 13, he knew he wanted to become an artist. In art, particularly dark art, he found a way to echo his emotions and channel his inner chaos and pain. “Dark art for me is a more radical form of surreal,” he says. “If surreal is the combination of dream and reality, dark art is the combination of reality and nightmares.” One year ago, Stanislav left his home country and joined likeminded artists in Los Angeles in order to start a new, self-determined life. “I was just a blind disabled in the Ukraine,” he says. “Here I am part of the dark art society and cultural life of the city. And the main thing is, I can make a living. I have friends, a lot of friends, and I’m not alone.” Photo by @standarkart
