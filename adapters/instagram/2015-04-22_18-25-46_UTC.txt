“A lot of people describe going out in nature as escaping things in their life,” says Colorado-based adventure photographer Carl Zoch (@carlzoch). “I tend to see it the other way — as returning to a holistic experience of life that returns us to what we’ve had all along.” Carl’s relationship with nature was heavily shaped by his college years living in the flat, mountainless regions of Middle America after a childhood spent in the Pacific Northwest. “Over time, I decided that I had to have this lifestyle that allowed me to be outside in places where I feel most alive, where I feel connected to myself and my surroundings,” says Carl. “I always felt I was at my best when I was outside and free to roam. I think I sense that in others, too.” Through his photography, Carl loves the challenge of making pictures that motivate others to live a more adventurous outdoor lifestyle. “That’s a lot of what drives what I do. I love inspiring others.” Photo by @carlzoch
