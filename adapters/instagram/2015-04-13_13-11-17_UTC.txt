“I like the fact that Bangkok has everything, but no clear organization,” says architect and designer Ratvanich Thepa, who goes by Noi (@noithepa). In this edition of #LocalLens, Noi shares some of his favorite places to shoot around his hometown of Bangkok. “On the east side of the Chao Phraya River, you can find history, handicrafts and the ancient way of life,” says Noi about the historical area of Rattanakosin Island. “There are temples, a royal palace, universities and lots of old communities, and it’s very charming.” He also likes to explore the abundant nature located not too far from the city. “You can travel east or west for less than an hour and get to the sea, and you can get to the rain forest – Khao Yai National Park – in an hour or two if you feel the need for some fresh air,” he says. Noi especially loves driving westward along the coastal route that leads directly down to southern Thailand, as well as Bang Pu — an old seaside resort located southeast of the city, where thousands of seagulls migrate from Siberia. “There are diverse ways of life and a mix of both old and new style houses and buildings,” Noi says of Bangkok, “so there’s always a lot going on.” Photo by @noithepa
