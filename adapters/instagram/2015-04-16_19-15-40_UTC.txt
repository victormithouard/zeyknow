“Even if I end up with no photographs I’m satisfied with, at least I have spent time in nature and outside in the fresh air,” says 32-year-old Mikko Lagerstedt (@mikkolagerstedt), a self-taught fine art photographer from Finland. “The weather, timing and lunar phases make it difficult to predict a good astrophotography day — that gives it a challenging twist. There is a sense of mystery every time I take a long-exposure, and you can’t know how the picture will turn out. It is one of the key things that inspires me to capture night photographs.” Photo by @mikkolagerstedt
