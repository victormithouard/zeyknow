“Nobody in their most delirious dreams, not even Gisele herself, imagined that she would become Gisele,” says Bob Wolfenson (@bobwolfenson), who has been photographing the model Gisele Bündchen (@giseleofficial) since she started her career at age 14. Much like Gisele, Bob also couldn’t imagine his own trajectory as one of Brazil’s most renowned portraiture photographers. Growing up in São Paulo, his first love was soccer, and he dreamt of playing in the professional league. Photography came into his life almost by accident, shortly after his father died when Bob was only 15. “I had to work, and a photographer’s assistant was the work I found,” he recalls. “It took me a while, eight years to be exact, to start enjoying it.” Over the years, Bob became well known for his portraits. “Portraits are about capturing an exact moment between the photographer and the subject,” he says. On Wednesday, after Gisele's final runway walk at São Paulo Fashion Week (@spfw), Bob was called upon to capture Gisele’s bittersweet goodbye. For Bob, the most emotional moment wasn’t backstage with Gisele, but watching her walk in the show. “It was very beautiful,” he says. “She and I both cried, and later we talked about that. She asked, ‘Why do I get emotional?’ And I said, ‘Because you are human.’” Throwback photo of Gisele, stylist Silvio Giorgio and Bob by @lucianaprezia
