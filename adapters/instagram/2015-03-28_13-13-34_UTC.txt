When Prinka Saraswati (@prinkasaraswati) makes a portrait, she’s looking for the person inside a person. “I try to capture their real personalities,” says Prinka, 21, who makes a living in Surabaya, Indonesia, as a kindergarten teacher, English tutor and photographer. “Seeing their insincere laugh when someone tells a lame joke or silent smile when they receive a text. Small, forgotten things like that.” Many of Prinka’s friends, whom she calls “beautiful creatures,” are also artists and she photographs them along with intimate moments from her life. “I love capturing melancholy stuff,” she says. “Lonely people, half a cup of black coffee or trees that move as the breeze goes by.” Photo by @prinkasaraswati
