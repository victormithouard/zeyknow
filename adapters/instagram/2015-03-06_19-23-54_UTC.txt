Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPeverydayheroes

The goal this weekend is to capture creative portraits of the people who inspire you. Some tips to get you started:

It doesn't take an act of greatness to become a hero. Think about the people whose everyday actions—no matter how big or small—make a difference in your life.  Seek them out, tell them why you appreciate them, and then ask to take their portrait. Use your portrait's setting to help give context to your story. Think about the location and details around your subject that will help you visualize the story you're trying to tell. As with all portraits, keep lighting in mind. Seek out indirect window light or overcast skies for a softer feel, or use hard, direct light for a more dramatic portrait.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPeverydayheroes hashtag only to photos taken this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken this weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
