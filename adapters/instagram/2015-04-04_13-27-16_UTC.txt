“An aspect that I find interesting in working with letters, is that the target audience is extremely wide,” says Cyril Vouilloz (@rylsee), a Swiss artist based in Berlin. “It can touch a variety of people and all for different reasons.” On the lookout for new ideas, Cyril always keeps his eyes and ears open and a sketchbook handy, because for him, inspiration can be found anywhere and everywhere: “From an old handwritten misworded note pinned on a door, bathroom poetry, to an Instagram profile tag line.” In his ongoing project “sketchbook2point0,” Cyril creates optical illusions, playfully challenging the viewer to question the veracity of the images they are exposed to every day. “In the era we live in, it’s sometimes difficult to know what is real and what isn’t,” he says. Admittedly being dragged to goofy punch lines, humor plays a big role in Cyril’s work. “I always feel rewarded when I see people laughing when looking at my artworks. I love the idea of creating something that might make someone’s day somewhere in the world!” Photo by @rylsee
