This weekend, we’re putting the Weekend Hashtag Project on hold for the 11th Worldwide InstaMeet. Grab a few friends or find an InstaMeet near you (community.instagram.com) and get creative. Share photos and videos from your adventures with the #WWIM11 hashtag, and tell us about your experience with the #MyFirstInstaMeet hashtag if it’s your first time joining the fun. Don’t forget to include in your caption your gathering’s location and unique hashtag.

Browse #WWIM11 throughout the weekend to explore communities around the world, and check back Monday for a look at some of our favorites.
