“#Hellomynameis Meghan Faulkner (@meghan_faulk), and I’m a 17-year-old aspiring writer and photographer based out of Chicago, Illinois. I think the most recurring theme in my feed would be the undeniable use of darkness in my photography. I don't hold onto that immaculate white light that everyone seems to be aesthetically drawn toward these days. It's from the shadow that I'm most compelled to create. It's from there that everything else emerges." Photo by @meghan_faulk
