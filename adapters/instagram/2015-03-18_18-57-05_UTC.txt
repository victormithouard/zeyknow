“Please send me pictures of my dog.” Two years ago, Antje Queissner (@aladiia) of Berlin received this message from her teenage son, who was traveling abroad. So Antje, a graphic designer, started to photograph her excursions with Sheila, the pup her son had picked out at a shelter the year before. “Soon, taking dog pictures wasn’t enough for me,” Antje recalls. She broadened her photography and started capturing her surroundings, trying to let the photographs tell little stories – stories of life in Berlin, oases in the urban jungle, architectural lines and a red umbrella that bounces through her images like a luminous point. “The umbrella has become my favorite accessory – next to Sheila – in my pictures. Whether it’s rainy or sunny, inside buildings or outside, the ideas just keep coming.” Photo by @aladiia
