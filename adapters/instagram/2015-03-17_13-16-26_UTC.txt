Australian fiber artist Natalie Miller (@natalie_miller_design) weaves more than 20 years of architecture and design experience into her works. “In architecture, you understand the design principles and integrate them together with materials to create something,” she explains. “The same principle applies when putting textiles together.” For Natalie, fibers, colors and textures have replaced the bricks, stone and glass with which she once worked.

Three years ago, Natalie and her family moved from Sydney to rural Kangaloon, located two hours south, and she now draws inspiration from the lush and scenic environment. “The space and the stillness in the country really allows you to stop and think and open up your creative side,” she says. Natalie’s channeled this creativity into innovative and radical weavings and macramé, an artistic knotting technique. Even as her work draws attention at home and abroad — Natalie’s held recent workshops in Hong Kong and Singapore — she doesn’t take things for granted: “I feel extraordinarily lucky to have such an opportunity to do what I love all the time.” Photo by @natalie_miller_design
