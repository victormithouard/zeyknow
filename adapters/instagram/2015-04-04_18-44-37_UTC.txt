Before the first pitch is thrown, before the fans stream in to take their seats, even before the scoreboard switches on, Adam Ottavino (@adamottavino) is at the ballpark taking photographs. “I like to get to the field early some days when there’s no one around and walk around with my camera,” says Adam, a professional baseball pitcher with the Colorado Rockies. “It just gives me something to take my mind off all the stuff that’s going on in my baseball life at that moment, and just allow me to appreciate where I am and soak up the environment that I’m lucky enough to be in. It puts my head back where it needs to be.” Photo by @adamottavino
