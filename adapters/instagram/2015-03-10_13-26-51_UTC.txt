For three decades, Madonna (@madonna) has paved the way on the acceptance of counterculture. But at a time when humanity has made great strides on gay rights and sexism, we still live in an era that, to her, seems to be moving backward as well; where artists are no longer allowed to speak as freely as they once were. Not that that stops her from doing what she wants. Madonna is still going to speak her mind, and still going to do bizarre and unique things, like using a sock puppet to promote her upcoming world tour. Most importantly, she still knows how to handle controversies better than any pop star in history, particularly now that she’s become more selfless. “I think I was pretty self-obsessed until I had children,” she says. “Being a mother brings up so many different emotions. But I don’t think it stopped me from saying what I want to say or doing what I want to do.” Photo by @madonna
