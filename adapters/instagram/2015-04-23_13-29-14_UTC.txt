Rio de Janeiro sculptor Marcelo Macedo (@marcelomacedo03) approaches each of his pieces of art as a puzzle, which he must solve during his scavenger hunt for material on the street. “I usually draw and write about the sculptures before creating them, but they are never as I imagined. A large part of my creative process is the hours I spend trying to find the next piece,” he says. Marcelo, who’s 31, began creating these sculptures during a difficult time in his life and has found solace in them. “They have come to represent my search for finding myself. Through them, I have found a purpose for my creative side,” he says.
