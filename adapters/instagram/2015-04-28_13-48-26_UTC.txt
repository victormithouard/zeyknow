“Kiteboarding gives you the chance to focus on that moment and truly live in the present,” says Hope LeVin (@hopelevin), a kiteboarder from the Turks and Caicos Islands, who picked up the sport at the young age of 11. A year ago, the now 22-year-old turned her passion into a career when she began riding the waves professionally. She has now mastered the art of taking selfies while suspended in mid-air above (or below) her board. “Getting good shots with my GoPro isn’t always easy. The angle is often wrong or I get an amazing shot but then there’s a huge water drop in the middle!” explains Hope. “It’s weird, but usually it’s the days where the conditions aren’t that great that I get my best images. I guess I’m focusing too much on having fun on the good days!” Photo by @hopelevin
