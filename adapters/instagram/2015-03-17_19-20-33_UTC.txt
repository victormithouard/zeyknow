“I think there is a deep well of emotion in us that gets tapped when we are confronted with the beauty of nature,” says Bridget Beth Collins (@flora.forager). The Seattle-based botanical artist reconstructs the blooms of nature into designs, creatures and scenes from her imagination. “From a young age I was learning the names of flowers and backpacking in mountain meadows. I played all day every day of the summer in the woods pretending to be a fairy.  I would bring home sprigs from the woods and press them in books,” says Bridget. 
The delicate organic materials that compose each piece are themselves a source of inspiration.  Bridget explains, “I go for a walk in my neighborhood or bring a bouquet home from the market and I see a whale’s tail in a shamrock leaf, or a snake’s scales in the sedum. And I am ever entranced by the public gardens and parks available in my city.” Photo by @flora.forager
