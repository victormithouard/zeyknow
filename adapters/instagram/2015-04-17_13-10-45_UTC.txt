“I started drawing on my nails when I found out that manicurists use acrylic paint, which is what I use for my artwork,” says Tokyo illustrator Yumi Kitagishi (@yumikitagishi). Yumi’s nail paintings began as something she did just for fun aside from her work, but as more people started noticing them through her photos and videos, her nail art has evolved to the point where she conducts live demonstrations at public events. “There really isn’t much to it, but I always try to look for new themes,” she says. According to Yumi, the challenging part about nail painting is drawing with her less dominant hand, explaining that it’s more about practice rather than technique. Most of the colorful characters that Yumi draws are people, cats and birds. “It’s hard to choose my favorite, but I would have to go with ‘the cat eating breakfast’ — this is a character that was first drawn on my nails and later ended up in my artwork,” she says. “The character seemed to develop on its own, and I find that interesting.” Video by @yumikitagishi
