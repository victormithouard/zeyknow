For California native Dana Roth (@dana_arr), the experience of living and working as a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, West Africa, has been nothing short of transformative. “Going into this, I really didn’t have an idea of what I was going to do in the future,” says Dana. “While I hoped that I’d be on a journey of self-discovery, up until recently I thought maybe that was a silly idea. But as I get further into my time here, I realize that I’ve changed a lot, and I’ve changed my mind about what I want to do in the future.” After spending a year and a half in a country that’s captured her heart, Dana is considering a career overseas — working for an aid organization, or, perhaps, in the Foreign Service.

To help cement long-term memories of her time in Senegal, Dana has been taking intimate photos of the people and her surroundings. But her Instagram feed is specifically tailored for one specific viewer. “Nearly everything I post is for my mom,” says Dana. “I take photos of people and things that she would be interested in.” Photo by @dana_arr
