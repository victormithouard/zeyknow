Colombian graphic designer Daniel Aristizábal (@darias88) describes his art as a “retro, colorful, geometric bonanza.” “I like things that seem out of place, things that don’t belong together,” he says. “I’ve been obsessed with images since I was a little kid. I always had weird sceneries and colors mixed in my mind.” Growing up in Medellín, Daniel was influenced by the architecture and fashion around him. He later studied motion graphic design in Barcelona, where he became interested in cubism, dadaism and futurism. “I think the term ‘pop surrealism’ works well for me,” he says. “My work is full of simplicity and organic shapes. It is nostalgic in its essence.” Photo by @darias88
