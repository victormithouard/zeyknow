Blending marriage and work may be a challenge for some, but Dabs and Myla — collectively known as Dabs Myla (@dabsmyla) — make it look easy. The Australian graffiti and street artists, who are based in Los Angeles, have been making bright, bold pop art since they met in school some 12 years ago. “We fell in love and straightaway started working together on projects and paintings,” says Myla. “After a few years, we found we loved working together so much more, so we made the decision to start solely working together under one name — and have been ever since.” The duo collaborates at every stage of their projects, from start to finish. “Usually we will call out at the beginning what each person would like to paint: ‘Is it cool if I paint the boy, the cat character, the car, the television and the flowers?’” Dabs says. “We make our work together and for each other.” Photo by @dabsmyla
