“I think I was about 14 or 15 when I told my parents that I wanted to make snowboard movies for a living,” recalls Aaron Leyland (@aaronleyland), a 30-year-old filmmaker and photographer from British Columbia. “When I first started snowboarding, we went regardless of conditions. We wouldn’t even check the snow report — rain, snow, wind, it didn’t matter to us at the time. Just pack the car and go.” Nowadays, Aaron isn’t so cavalier about weather forecasts and conditions, especially before setting out on a shoot, but his passion for snowboarding adventures isn’t any less wild than when he was young. “What keeps me going is the search for new terrain, to be able to cruise through deep snow on the sleds, breaking trail through the trees and ending up in the alpine with perfect features to snowboard on,” he says. “It’s easier said than done — the stars don’t often align like that. But they do occasionally, and that’s what really motivates me.” Photo by @aaronleyland
