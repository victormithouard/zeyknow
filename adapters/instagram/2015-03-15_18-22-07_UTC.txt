“We had been tidying away the breakfast dishes when he decided he wanted a bath. And with the sun shining on his back, a cup of tea in my hand, I sat and enjoyed my youngest in that little perfect moment. I’m glad I captured it,” says stay-at-home mom Fiona Annal (@fionaannal). As a mother of three, Fiona shares moments from her family life in Orkney, a cluster of more than 70 rural islands in the north of Scotland, from Sunday mornings making pancakes to reading books at bedtime. For Fiona, Mother’s Day — which is celebrated on March 15 in the UK — is an opportunity to get creative and appreciate the small moments with her children. “Their little expectant faces as they clutch their homemade treasures behind their backs are my favorite part! It’s just nice to get that validation that you’re doing an OK job!” Photo by @fionaannal
