After shooting backstage at fashion shows in London and Paris for four years, London-based photographer Ambra Vernuccio (@ambravernuccio) says she could write a guidebook on how to survive fashion week. “The quality of the images need to be as good as a studio portrait,” she says. “Three main things help: playful models, an abundance of space, and time. You only have a few seconds to capture that magic moment before someone from production, hair, makeup or a fellow photographer gets into your shot and breaks it. I try to immortalize and deliver the vision of the designer through my images.” Photo from backstage at @kenzo #pfw by @ambravernuccio
