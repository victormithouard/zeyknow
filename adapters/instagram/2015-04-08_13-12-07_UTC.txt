“They said being a photographer is some crazy dream I would never attain,” says Bangladeshi photojournalist Ismail Ferdous (@ismailferdous), describing the initial reactions from his family when he told them his career ambitions. “But I knew inside that I was going to pursue photography.” Having found his calling, Ismail set out into the world, capturing vignettes of life from South East Asia to Latin America to the conflicted border of Turkey and Syria. At home in Bangladesh, he continues to work on a long-term project called “The Cost of Fashion” that began on April 24th, 2013, when a clothing factory collapsed in Dhaka, killing and wounding thousands of garment workers inside. He reflects on the path he chose, saying, “it took a while to feel confident inside myself that I could do this job. Before I could convince other people I had to convince myself.” Photo by @ismailferdous
