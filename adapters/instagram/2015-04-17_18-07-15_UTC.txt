Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPidrewthis

The goal this weekend is to share creative drawings and illustrations of things you might ordinarily photograph. Some tips to get you started: 
If you’re not used to sketching, don’t let a new medium intimidate you. Whether it’s on sticky notes and napkins or in your best sketchbook, grab a pen and let the world around you flow onto the paper. No matter how much your drawing does or doesn’t resemble your subject, be proud of what you’ve created and share it anyway. Illustration opens up a blank canvas of new possibilities. Be as inventive or as abstract as you want to be and let your imagination run wild. Finally, use your caption to help fill in the details of the scene. Share details like sounds, smells and feelings to make your sketch come alive.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPidrewthis hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
