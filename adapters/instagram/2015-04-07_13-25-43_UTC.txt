“Latin America is like a punch in the nose. It suddenly gets your attention. It startles you,” says Eduardo Lindes Burnao (@murnaudenlinden), who draws inspiration from that region for his illustrations.

Eduardo, a graphic designer from Spain currently living in London, loves to explore the Latin American culture. “That’s why I use primary, basic colors like yellow or blue because I want people to be shocked by the drawings.” His grandfather used to listen to folk Latin music and that left a cultural footprint on Eduardo, whose goal now is to build bridges across the Atlantic. “I think Europe still has some unpaid debt with Latin America, and there’s still a lot of ignorance about that region and its important role in the world.” He hopes his illustrations will help with that. “In this moment, in the world we live in, we need some joy, more color, more flavor.” Photo by @murnaudenlinden
