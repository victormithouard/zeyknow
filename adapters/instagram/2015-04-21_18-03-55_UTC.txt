“#Hellomynameis Felix Pomo (@wikingens) and I’m a 16-year-old photographer from Stockholm. I’m always trying to show the world the way I see it. My photography is very personal — it resembles who I am and what I see. There are so many things we take for granted and don’t notice. As a kid, I always played by the lake or in the woods, but never realized it could be so beautiful. This is the reason I love photography, because we all have different ways of seeing the same things.” Photo of @wikingens by @meetjulian
