“I have really vivid dreams and I remember them all the time,” says James Livitski (@thegentlemanbronco), a self-taught graphic designer from Toronto who gets the ideas for his art while sleeping soundly. Most of James’ works are digital re-creations of his dreams – futuristic scenarios inspired by unknown spheres of the universe, retro photography, vintage pinup girls and music. “You can put a headset on, close your eyes and the tune takes you to a whole new world,” James explains, hoping that his art might touch people in a similar way. “I create it to take you away from anything that’s happening for that one second in your life, and make you feel something you’ve never felt, and make you see something you could only imagine in your wildest dreams and make it your reality.”
