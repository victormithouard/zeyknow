Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPdoubletake

The goal this weekend is to capture creative photos of unique pairings. Some tips to get you started:

Seek out subjects that naturally come in twos. Don’t forget that not all duos look alike — opposites also come in pairs. As you shoot, aim to highlight similarities while also celebrating differences. For example, focus on the ways identical twins differ or how an odd couple can come together. Put thought into your composition. Play with distance, perspective and framing, and use your setting to add context or tell a story.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdoubletake hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.
