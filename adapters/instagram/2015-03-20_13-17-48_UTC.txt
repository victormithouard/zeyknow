Stasha Becker (@northwestmommy), a lifestyle photographer who lives on Whidbey Island in Washington, uses photographs to tell the story of her everyday life with her family: her husband, their son Julian, an Arabian stallion named Vizon and their dogs — two Newfoundlands named Max and Bruce. “Long time ago I began to take a photo of my son often in the same spot in front of our garage door,” she says. “If you scroll through my photos you can see our child growing up, our dogs getting older and our garage door getting dirtier. For me it has become an essential part of my family's story and an evolving record of our happiness together.” Photo by @northwestmommy
