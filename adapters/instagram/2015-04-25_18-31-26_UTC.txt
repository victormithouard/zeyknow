“Our theme for our journey is ‘How Far From Home’ – to see how far we can actually get,” says Chanel Cartell (@howfarfromhome), who, along with her partner Stevo Dirnberger, recently decided to break out of her comfort zone of monthly paychecks, daily work routines and a beautiful house in Johannesburg. “We quit our jobs in the creative field of advertising, sold all of our belongings and packed up our world into four bags – two filled with camera gear, of course,” says Chanel, adding, “We were no longer feeling challenged; we needed something that would charge the electrolytes running through our veins.” On March 2, Chanel and Stevo waved Johannesburg goodbye and embarked on their year-long journey – armed with a sense of adventure and a “wanderlist.” While having coffee and Sachertorte in Vienna and taking a selfie with an alpaca are already checked off the list, missions like dancing in Berlin, eating Danish pastries in Copenhagen, and sleeping in an igloo are still outstanding. “We encourage fellow travelers and community members to send us challenges that we can add to the wanderlist,” says Chanel. “I think our favorite – or the one we’ll save
for last – is to make it to Hawaii, quite literally the furthest point from home.” Photo by @howfarfromhome
