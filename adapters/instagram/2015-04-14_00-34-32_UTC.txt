Hello, Instagram! Today’s #WeeklyFluff is a special #TaxDay edition, in honor of Wednesday’s tax filing deadline in the US. Meet Toast (@toastmeetsworld), a handsomely tongued King Charles spaniel rescue. When Toast isn’t number crunching, he’s spending his time raising awareness about puppy mills and advocating pet adoption. To add a touch of puppy tongue to your Instagram feed, follow @toastmeetsworld.
