Kate Gavino (@lastnightsreading) lives and breathes books. By day, the New York City resident works in publishing, and by night she attends literary events around the city. Every time Kate sees an author speak, she illustrates the experience. The habit started two years ago, after an inspiring talk given by acclaimed Dominican-American novelist Junot Díaz. “One quote stood out to me so much I just had to illustrate it,” she says. Soon, Kate started bringing a small notebook and pen with her to every reading. “Authors have been very positive, which means a lot to me.” Among her favorite author experiences was listening to iconic American writer Toni Morrison. “I like seeing authors who make the audience go ‘mm-hmm!’ after each sentence they say,” she says.
