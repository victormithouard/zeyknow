“They are identical twins, but their characters are nothing alike,” says graphic designer Akira Oozawa (@sunmoooon). “The older one is cautious and dependent, and the younger one is short-tempered, selfish and breaks everything that comes in her way.” Akira documents his daily life in the Kinki region of Japan with his twin preschool-age daughters, a fifth grade daughter and a third grade son.

Although Akira says he’s never seen or felt any “twin telepathy” between the girls, he says their bond is especially tight: “When my son and one of the twins starts fighting, it always ends up turning into a one-on-two.” Akira aims to capture natural, in-the-moment expressions of his family: “I want to continue recording the growth of my kids through photography — whether they like it or not.” Photo by @sunmoooon
