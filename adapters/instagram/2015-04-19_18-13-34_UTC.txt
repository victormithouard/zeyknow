Graphic designer-turned-multimedia artist Paige Smith (@acommonname) has lost count of her “urban geodes” that occupy the nooks and crannies of decay in places as far-flung as Bali, Madrid and Istanbul.

It all began three years ago in downtown Los Angeles, where Paige was living. “I started noticing the cracks and holes and decaying surfaces of our buildings, and that no one seemed to be paying attention to them,” she says. “The idea clicked to utilize these spaces and create something beautiful.” Paige started by using a paper-cutting and folding technique called kirigami to create three-dimensional installations that look like geodesic formations. While she still prefers this method for her large-scale installations, her process has evolved to incorporate crystals of silicon-molded resin. The resulting works draw attention by juxtaposing inorganic formations that appear natural against the backdrop of a deteriorating man-made landscape.

Like the walls and buildings they inhabit, Paige’s works also decay over time. “I appreciate the mystery of their demise,” she says. “It’s a natural occurrence.” Photo by @acommonname
