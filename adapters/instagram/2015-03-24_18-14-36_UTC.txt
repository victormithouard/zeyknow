Photographer Krisanne Johnson (@krisannejohnson) gravitates toward stories about youth culture. Her most recent black-and-white images from the streets of South Africa continue her eight-year-long commitment to documenting the country’s first generation to be born free of racial segregation. “I think young adults express an energy and rawness that can truly reflect the climate of a country,” says Krisanne. “I wanted to document the first post-apartheid generation to come of age and their experience of growing up in a democracy that is complex and young.” Since 2007, Krisanne, a New York-based former White House staff photographer, has pieced together different chapters of the post-apartheid story, from broader subcultures to intimate, daily life portraits of her subjects. “On my most recent trip, I’ve been looking at issues surrounding housing rights, unemployment, income inequality and social segregation in Cape Town,” she says. “I spent three months there and I’ve only started to crack the surface.” Photo by @krisannejohnson
