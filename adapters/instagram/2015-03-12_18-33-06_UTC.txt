“#Hellomynameis Gigi Crouch (@scolerina9247). I just turned 17 and I am currently living in Seattle. I have scoliosis, a curvature of the spine. At the moment, I have three major curves in my back, the largest measuring about 30 degrees. I wore a back brace for three years while continuing to pursue ballet, and I have just recently stopped wearing it.

I dance because it feels natural. Working hard in class and seeing results gives me a feeling of absolute satisfaction. I believe that I have grown many ways creatively over this past year, especially with my photography. I love to try to explore new angles and poses daily to get an output that is innovative, creative and pleasing to the eye. I hope that my pictures inspire others, and show them that nothing can stop you if you have passion.” Photo of @scolerina9247 by @maysunrae
