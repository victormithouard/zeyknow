“The modern era keeps us in a very alert rhythm, but sometimes we have to remind ourselves to slow down and admire what is around us. It’s such a pity to miss all those special moments,” says Mihail Onaca (@mihailonaca), who recently moved to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, from the northern part of the country to pursue acting. Mihail is inspired by the baroque architecture and café culture of the vibrant city, which is the historic capital of Transylvania, and especially likes capturing its large squares, like Piata Unirii and Piata Mihai Viteazu. He also likes to show how the open spaces contrast the distinctive narrow streets in the old town: “Inner courtyards, hallways, hidden places – all of these can contain something special for the eye.” For more from Mihail’s #LocalLens on Cluj-Napoca, @mihailonaca.
