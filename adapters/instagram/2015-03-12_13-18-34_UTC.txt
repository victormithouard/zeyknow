“In most sports, you either win or lose. But climbing is about your own personal experience,” says 28-year-old Brazilian rock climber and photographer Bruno Graciano (@brungraciano). Bruno began climbing at the age of 15 near his hometown in Minas Gerais. Back then, his mother encouraged him to focus on his schoolwork. “Like any good mother, she would say, ‘Go study, there is no future in climbing,’” Bruno recalls. Nowadays, Bruno has found his calling as a professional photographer focused on outdoor sports, allowing him to combine his passion for photography with his athletic skills. Like photography, climbing allows Bruno to get creative. “Every climb is different, and you are always faced with something new,” he says. “That is very inspiring.” Photo by @brungraciano
