French artist Charles Leval, also known as “Levalet” (@levaletdessinderue), is bringing new narratives to the streets of Paris with life-size black-and-white figures. “My task is to adapt each image to the physical limitations of the urban space through a kind of staging or dramatization,” he says.

Charles uses India ink to draw his images in his studio, then pastes the characters onto places like walls, ledges and doors across the city. “First I spot a location, then I take some measurements and make a note of any other details about the place,” he says. “Next, I think of an overall plan and I draw the various elements that I want to appear before returning to install them on site. For the drawing, I work by following a photo, so usually I get people to pose in the situations that I want to portray.” Photo by @levaletdessinderue
