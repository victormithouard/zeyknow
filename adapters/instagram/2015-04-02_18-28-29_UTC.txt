When Yuka Igarashi (@yuka_____i) shares her “outfit of the day” (#ootd) the results are subtle: the images beguilingly frame her look and obscure her face. “This style has been the same since I started,” says Yuka, an accountant in Gifu, Japan, explaining that the outfits were never meant to find a wider audience. “My sixth grade daughter takes the photos. It was only meant as a memorandum of what I wear.” The style reflects her understated life. “I like colors that match my surroundings,” she says. “Simple earth colors are really hard to coordinate, but I like them because they are calm.” Photo by @yuka_____i
