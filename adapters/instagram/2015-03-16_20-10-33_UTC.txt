Inspired by the work of guest curator Balazs Gardi (@balazsgardi), this weekend’s prompt, #WHPfromthewater, asked participants to capture creative photos and videos that reflect on humanity’s connection with water. Every Monday we share some of our favorite Weekend Hashtag Project submissions on our blog at blog.instagram.com. Congratulations to @robbiecrawford, @robmulally, @dimitri.pappa, @gsfoofan, @matthewtaylorthomas, @freyahartas, @sandyjonesphoto, @haakonrasmusrasmussen and @jonazeuqsalev who all had featured submissions for #WHPfromthewater!
